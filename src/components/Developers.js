            This Bible reading app was built using React to provide a smooth and
            accessible reading experience for users. The design is optimized for
            readability, with a clean interface and customizable themes (Light
            and Dark Mode).

            The app uses the Bible API to fetch the text of the Bible in various
            translations. The API is free to use and provides accurate and
            up-to-date versions of the Bible in multiple languages.
